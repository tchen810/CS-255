Our client DriverPass approached us for a new system for their driver's license tutoring company. They needed a system to facilitate customer registration, session reservation, online learning, and user management.
I believe we met expectations when we outlined each functionality that our client voiced, consolidating their vision for the system into a high-level visual. Although, upon reflection, we could strive for a more detailed business requirement document in the future.
We did our best to distill what our client wanted out of the system, aligning with our mission to tailor the systems we create to the ideals of the client. We take pride in creating bespoke systems that fit each client perfectly. From how we see it, we are no different from bespoke tailors. 
Our clients come to us because they want a system that fits, and that's exactly what we give them. In the future, we will continue to utilize strategies that work. We will extensively communicate with our clients, understand their needs, create diagrams to communicate our understanding, and work together with our clients.
We prioritize clarity, collaboration, and communication, and that is what allows us to produce high-quality systems that satisfy every client that walks through our doors.
